# 1. Reproducible research means…

research in which the steps and processes taken to achieve the result are clear, freely available and complete to encourage certain principles behind research and data.


# 2. Benefits of conducting reproducible research
- Misinformation/interpretation is harder to spread.
- Discourgaes dishonest behaviour from researchers.

## Benefits for society

Misinformation harder to spread
more robust checking of scientific research

## For individual researchers

Encourages principles behind free and open research
less space for mistakes.
more inter-peer communication

# 3. Challanges in doing open research

ensuring reproducibility. 
encouraging more researchers to take this up.
(privately) funded research


# 4. Top three learning points from the SMI205 module for future
