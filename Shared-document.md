# 1. Reproducible research means…

<!-- Explain in a way a lay person would easily understand what reproducible research is. Feel free to use a metaphor or not be entirely serious
-->

Reproducible research is enabling others to test your research to see if
you get the same results. To help others to test your research, you must
provide as much information as possible. It is like asking someone to
test a new recipe, and helping them test it by providing all the
ingredients and equipment beforehand.

# 2. Benefits of conducting reproducible research

<!-- List a few benefits of doing reproducible research for different community groups, international community or any research communities
-->

# 4. Top three learning points from the SMI205 module for future

<!-- What practices you think will be useful for you next year when writing a dissertation or in future career?
-->

-   1.  critically analysing a quant literature review and including our
        own results

-   2.  expanding on our r knowledge as well as now using github
